# Local-AI-Chatbot-using-LangChain-Ollama-LLaMA-2-
This project is a fully local AI chatbot built from scratch using open-source tools. 
The focus is on understanding how modern LLM systems actually work beyond simple prompting.

## 📌 Project Overview

Over the past few days, I worked on building a local AI chatbot that runs entirely on my machine.

The goal of this project was learning by building, debugging, and understanding the internal flow of LLM pipelines.

## 🛠 What I Implemented

- LangChain prompt pipelines  
- Ollama (LLaMA 2) as a local LLM  
- Streamlit UI for interaction  
- Debugged real-world issues (ports, models, context limits)  
- Learned how LLMs behave beyond “just prompting”

## 🧠 Key Learning

> **“The code is short, but the learning behind it is deep.”**

Building AI is NOT about tools — it’s about understanding  
how context, tokens, models, and pipelines work together.

## 🔜 Next Step

Turning this into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project:

**Company Knowledge Assistant**
- Reduce hallucination  
- Answer questions from private documents

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python  
- LangChain  
- Ollama  
- Streamlit  
- LLaMA 2

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

If you’re learning GenAI seriously — build, break, and debug.  
That’s where real learning happens.
